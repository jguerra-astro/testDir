\section{Problem Set 1}
	\begin{p}
		\textbf{Apparent magnitude of a supernova (2 pts)}

		\noindent
		The absolute magnitude of a start in the galaxy M81 (distance 3.6 Mpc) is $M=6.$ It explodes as a supernova, and becomes $10^9.5$ times brighter. What is the apparent magnitude of the supernova?
	\end{p}

	\begin{p}
		\textbf{Fourier Transform of the step function (3 pts)}

		\noindent
		Find the fourier transform  of the function $f(t)$ define as:
		\begin{equation}
		  f(t) =
		  \begin{cases}
		   1 & \abs{t} <1 \\
		   0 & \text{otherwise} \\
		  \end{cases}
		\end{equation}
	\end{p}

	\begin{p}
		\textbf{Fourier Transform of irregularly sampled data (5 pts)}

		\noindent
		The time series of energy emitted by a variable astronomical source is give by:
		\begin{equation}
			f(t)=a_{1}cos(\omega_{1}t -\delta_{1})
		\end{equation}
		Find the fourier transform of this function if the signal is detected with gaps. That is, it is observed from time $t=0$ to $t=T$ and then re-obseved after 3 nights (after an elapsed time $t_{0}$) from $t_{0}$ to $t_{0}+T$ Plot the power spectrum of this source. Also show how the power spectrum changes as the sampling gap $t_{0}$ is increased to $1.5T$ and $2T.$

		\textbf{Radiation from nearly isotropic sources (5 pts)}

		\noindent
		When the radiation field is very nearly isotropic, we can expand the intensity $I(\theta)$ in a taylor series about $\theta =0$ as follows: 
		\begin{equation}
			I(\theta)= I_{0} + I_{1} cos(\theta) + ...
		\end{equation}
		Where $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ are independent of $\theta$. Relate these two coefficients to the flux and energy density of the field. Under what conditions on the energy density and flux does the following relation hold:
		\begin{equation}
			\abs{F^{in}_{\nu}} = \abs{F^{out}_{\nu}} = \pi I_{\nu}
		\end{equation}
	\end{p}

		\textbf{Energy density of radiation from a central source (10 pts)}
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item Show that the mean intensity at a distance r from a uniformly bright sphere of radius $R$ is give by:
			\begin{equation}
				J_{\nu}=\frac{1}{2} I_{\nu} \Bigg[1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}}\Bigg].
			\end{equation}
			\item Show that surface brightness $I_{\nu}$ of the sphere is given in terms of its monochromatic luminosity by:
			\begin{equation}
				I_{\nu}= \frac{L_{\nu}}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}.
			\end{equation}
			\item Hence show that the total (i.e. frequency integrated) energy density of radiation at a distance r from a uniformly emitting sphere, where r is large compared to its radius, is given by: 
			\begin{equation}
				u=\frac{L}{4\pi c r^2}.
			\end{equation}
			Where $L$ is the luminosity. Note that $u$ is independent of the radius of the sphere. 
			\item  Estimate the energy density of sunlight at the Earths orbit but outside the Earths atmosphere. You will need the following parameters:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Luminosity of the Sun: \SI{3.83e26}{\watt}
				\item Sun - Earth distance: \SI{1.5e11}{\meter}
			\end{itemize}
			Express your answer both in units of $J m^{-3}$ and in $eV m^{-3}$.

	\begin{p}
		\textbf{Eddington Atmospheres (5 pts)}

		\noindent
		Show that the solution to the radiative transfer equation under the eddinton approximation is no self-consistent, i.e. compare the expresssions for $J$ in terms of the flux calculated at the surface with and without making the approximation.
